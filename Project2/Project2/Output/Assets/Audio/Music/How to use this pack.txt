Trailer Music - two full-length trailer pieces to use in your video game trailer or any promotional materials

Event Music - three short sound assets to use when things happen in the game

Music Loops (wilderness/town):

These are background music loops 
They will loop seamlessly forever, just drag them next to eachother (or check out the included video for a more detailed demo)
Daytime loops are more energetic, nightfall loops are more relaxed
The daytime/nightfall loops of each zone fit together well i.e. town nightfall 1 and 2 both fit together consecutive to add variation

Music Loops (battle):

Loop seamlessly
For use in fight/battle scenes
Variable intensity loops can be added over the top of the corresponding battle loop and made louder/quieter to change the intensity of the music
For example, boss battle 1 (loop) and boss battle variable intensity 1 (loop) go together
The music could start off as just the original boss battle loop but you could fade in the variable intensity as the battle progresses to make it more intense
You could also fade it in and out depending on the player's health (i.e. if they go low health, the intensity loop gets louder, then goes away as their health goes up)
This is a great way to add immersion via the soundtrack
